# access

A simple syscall wrapper that requires no handles to perform operations with `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS` privilege.

## Usage

1. Load the driver.
2. Load the DLL (wrapper) into a program that needs to open a handle to a protected process.
3. The program can now perform privileged operations without creating a real handle.

## Note

- The wrapper is designed to be loaded in a x64 process and only implements the syscalls that pertain to my workflow.
- Only tested on Windows 10 1903, 1809, and 1803.
